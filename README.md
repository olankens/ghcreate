# <samp>OVERVIEW</samp>

Shell scripts to create various types of project on GitHub.
They were created for GitHub leveraging GitHub CLI and Actions.
Those are highly opinionated with strict defaults and they were forged with perfectionism in mind.
You're totally free to use those scripts and make them yours, I even highly encourage you to do so.
